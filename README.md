StaffPin plugin
============
> StaffPin is a 1.8.x - 1.17.x compatible spigot plugin that allows you to have security for your staff.

How it works ?
============
> When connecting to the server, people with the "pin.use" permission must register their pin with the command "/pin set <string>", then during their next connection they must send this pin in the chat within a period of time of 20 seconds.
